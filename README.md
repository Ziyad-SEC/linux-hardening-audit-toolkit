# 🛡️ Linux Hardening & Audit Toolkit (LHAT)

This is a hands-on project as part of my career transition into cybersecurity.  
The toolkit will help audit, secure, and harden Linux systems by applying real-world security best practices.

## 🔍 Purpose
To learn, build, and demonstrate practical Linux hardening techniques.  
The toolkit will include checklists, scripts, and tools for system auditing.

## 📅 Daily Learning Log

### ✅ Day 1 - What is Hardening?
- Learned the concept of system hardening
- Understood why hardening is critical for Linux security
- Real-world examples: disabling root SSH login, removing unused services
- Created notes for future audits

🗂️ Notes can be found in the `/notes/` folder.
