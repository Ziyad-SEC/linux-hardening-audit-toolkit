# ðŸ“š Day 1 â€“ Hardening Basics

## What is Hardening?
Hardening is the process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability. It involves:
- Disabling unnecessary services
- Removing unused software
- Enforcing secure configurations

## Why is it Needed?
A default Linux system might have open ports, services, and weak policies that attackers exploit. Hardening helps:
- Reduce attack surface
- Increase resistance against threats
- Ensure compliance with best practices

## Real-world Examples
- Disable SSH login for root
- Uninstall FTP server if not used

## Next Steps
- Learn file permissions
- Explore audit tools
- Begin scripting checks
