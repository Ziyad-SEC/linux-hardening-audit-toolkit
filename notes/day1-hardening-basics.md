# 📚 Day 1 – Understanding Hardening

## 🔐 What is System Hardening?
System hardening is the process of tightening security by reducing vulnerabilities in a Linux system.

### Examples:
- 🔒 Disabling root SSH login
- ❌ Removing unused packages/services
- 🔧 Setting secure file permissions

## 🚨 Why It Matters
Default Linux installations may have:
- Open ports
- Weak configurations
- Unnecessary daemons

Hardening helps:

✅ Reduce attack surface  
✅ Improve defense against threats  
✅ Achieve compliance

## 📌 Next Steps
- Learn Linux file & directory permissions
- Explore `auditd`, `ufw`, and password policies
- Start automating basic checks
